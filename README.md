# Transfer Learning for HSI with ImageNet Pre-Trained Models (InceptionResNetV2)

Pavia University dataset is the remote sensing data for hyperspectral image classification, which has 610x340 pixels and 103 channels. In this work, four ImageNet basic pre-trained models, VGG16, DenseNet121, ResNet50V2, and InceptionResNetV2 have used for HSI classification. The aim of Transfer Learning is to transfer the knowledge to the target domain from the source domain.
